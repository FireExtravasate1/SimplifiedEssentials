# SimplifiedEssentials
A Spiggot 1.20.4 Minecraft plugin

Developers: fireextravasate1/fireextravasate, xxawesqmexx

Essentialsx is a very big plugin with a lot of features that you dont really need, this plugin keeps some of the most useful ones from it and discards the rest.
This is a very simple and new plugin, but I'm planning on adding more features such as customiazble cooldowns for each command, and generally making it cleaner.
It will slowly recieve some updates, such as a command cooldown, but if you need to contact the developers you can message me on Discord at "fireextravasate1"

It includes:

Custom first-join messages (Color codes)
Custom join messages (Color codes)
Custom command prefix (Color codes)

The ability to enable/disable any of the commands in the config
The ability to enable/disable all the commands in the config
The ability to enable/disable the custom join messages
